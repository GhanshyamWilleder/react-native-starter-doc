# Initializie project

**Setup the project** 
There are two ways you can setup the react native project

- **With Framework**

Framework like **expo**

```sh
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

- **Without Framework**

Direct using simple **react-native templete**

```sh
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init <project-name>
```
inplace of project-name give the project a name 

- **While initialization of react native project**

By default it used yarn (if you have installed **yarn globally** or you have **enable corepack**) and if you haven't installed yarn by any ways it will take npm
